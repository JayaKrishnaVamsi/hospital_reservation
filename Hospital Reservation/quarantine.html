    <h2>When to Quarantine</h2>
    <ul>
<li>Stay home if you might have been exposed to COVID-19</li>
<li>Local public health authorities determine and establish the quarantine options for their jurisdictions.</li>
<li>Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others.</li>
<li>Quarantine helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms. People in quarantine should stay home, separate themselves from others, monitor their health, and follow directions from their state or local health department.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quarantine or isolation: What's the difference?</h3>
<p>Quarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others.</p>
<p>Isolation keeps someone who is infected with the virus away from others, even in their home.</p>

<div class="mySlides">
    <h2>Who needs to quarantine?</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19—excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months or who are fully vaccinated.</li>
    <li>People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms.</li>
    <li>People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.</li>
    <li>People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are not required to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated against the disease and show no symptoms.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
    <h2>What counts as close contact?</h2>
<ul>
<li>You were within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more</li>
<li>You provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19</li>
<li>You had direct physical contact with the person (hugged or kissed them)</li>
<li>You shared eating or drinking utensils</li>
<li>They sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
    <h2>Steps to take</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stay home and monitor your health</li>
<li>Stay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19.</li>
<li>Watch for fever (100.4◦F), cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19</li>
<li>If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
   <h2> After stopping quarantine, you should</h2>
<ul>
<li>Watch for symptoms until 14 days after exposure.</li>
<li>If you have symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact your local public health authority or healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet from others, wash your hands, avoid crowds, and take other steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</li>
<li>CDC continues to endorse quarantine for 14 days and recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus. </li>
