    <h2>When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated</h2>
    <p>Based on what we know about COVID-19 vaccines, people who have been fully vaccinated can start to do some things that they had stopped doing because of the pandemic.</p>
    <p>After you’ve been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking precautions in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces.</p>
    
    <h3>Have You Been Fully Vaccinated?</h3>
    People are considered fully vaccinated:

    2 weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose series, like the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or
    2 weeks after a single-dose vaccine, like Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine
    If it has been less than 2 weeks since your shot, or if you still need to get your second dose, you are NOT fully protected.
    Keep taking all prevention steps until you are fully vaccinated.

    <h2>What’s Changed</h2>
    If you’ve been fully vaccinated:
    <ul>
    <li>You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask.</li>
    <li>You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from one other household without masks, unless any of those people they live with has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</li>
    <li>If you’ve been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms.</li>
    <li>However, if you live in a group setting and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don’t have symptoms.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>What Hasn’t Changed</h2>
    <p>For now, if you’ve been fully vaccinated:</p>
    
    <p>You should still take steps to protect yourself and others in many situations, like wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces.</p>
    <p>Take these precautions whenever you are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>In public</li>
    <li>Gathering with unvaccinated people from more than one other household</li>
    <li>Visiting with an unvaccinated person who is at increased risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 or who lives with a person at increased risk</li>
    <li>Avoid medium or large-sized gatherings.</li>
    <li>Delay domestic and international travel.</li>
    <li>You should still watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, especially if you’ve been around someone who is sick. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested and stay home and away from others.</li>
    <li>You will still need to follow guidance at your workplace.</li>
