    <h1> Symptoms of Coronavirus</h1>
    <h2>What you need to know</h2>
    <p>Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms.
    Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
    Watch for symptoms
    People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Fever or chills</li>
    <li>Cough</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
    <li>Sore throat</li>
    <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
    <li>Diarrhea</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.</p>

    <h2>When to seek emergency medical attention</h2>
    <p>Look for emergency warning signs for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Trouble breathing</li>
    <li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>
    <li>New confusion</li>
    <li>Inability to wake or stay awake</li>
    <li>Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone</li>

    <h2>What is the difference between Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses.</li>
        <li>COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with influenza virus.</li>
        <li>COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people.</li> 
        <li>It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. </li>
        <li>Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing  may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.</li>
        <li>While more is learned every day about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, there is still a lot that is unknown .</li>
