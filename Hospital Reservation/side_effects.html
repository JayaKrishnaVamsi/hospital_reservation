    <h1>Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</h1>
<p>COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you from getting COVID-19. You may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. These side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects.</p>

Common side effects:
<ul>
On the arm where you got the shot:
<ul>
<li>Pain</li>
<li>Redness</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
</ul>
Throughout the rest of your body:
<ul>
<li>Tiredness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Muscle pain</li>
<li>Chills</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
</ul>
</ul>

   <h2> Helpful tips</h2>
<p>Talk to your doctor about taking over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, or antihistamines, for any pain and discomfort you may experience after getting vaccinated. You can take these medications to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally.</p>
<p>It is not recommended you take these medicines before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent side effects.</p>

To reduce pain and discomfort where you got the shot
<ul>
<li>Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area.</li>
<li>Use or exercise your arm.</li>
</ul>
To reduce discomfort from fever
<ul>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids.</li>
<li>Dress lightly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Side effects after your second shot may be more intense than the ones you experienced after your first shot. These side effects are normal signs that your body is building protection and should go away within a few days.</p>

    <h2>When to call the doctor</h2>
<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection.</p>
Contact your doctor or healthcare provider:
<ul>
<li>If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours</li>
<li>If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days</li>
</ul>
<h3>Remember</h3>
Side effects can affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days.
It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination.
After you are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.
After you’ve been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking precautions in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and washing your hands often.
