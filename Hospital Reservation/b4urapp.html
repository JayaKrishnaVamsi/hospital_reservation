<p>These tips will help you know what to expect when you get vaccinated, what information your provider will give you, and resources you can use to monitor your health after you are vaccinated.</p>

<p>Learn more about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines and how they work.</p>

Considerations for taking medication before getting vaccinated:
<ul>
<li>For most people, it is not recommended to avoid, discontinue, or delay medications for underlying medical conditions around the time of COVID-19 vaccination.</li>
<li>Not recommended you take over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen, before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent vaccine-related side effects.</li>
<li>However, if you take these medications regularly for other reasons, you should keep taking them before you get vaccinated.</li>
<li>Not recommended to take antihistamines before getting a COVID-19 vaccine to try to prevent allergic reactions.</li>
<li>If you have questions about medications that you are taking, talk to your doctor or your vaccination provider.</li>
